Getting data into and out of R is a major part of any real world data science project. Chapters 21 through 25 of [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund provide a good overview of these issues. Read those chapters and complete the associated tutorials from the [**r4ds.tutorials**]() package.

## Summary


*Pulling data into and out of R is a key factor in the data science process.*

*Use files like CSV, Excel, RDS, JSON, and SQL files/databases to organize and share your data.*

*Use SelectorGadget to pull data off of websites.*
