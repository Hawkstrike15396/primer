## Steps to Take in Every Data Science Problem

### Question

Start with the question. This will generally be something simple, easily expressed in just a sentence, using colloquial language. Every data science problem starts with a question. The goal is to provide an answer to the question, along with your uncertainty about that answer. The most common form for the answer is a posterior probability distribution. This PPD is either the answer itself, or the tool we use to answer the question. Example:

"What proportion of people who make $100,000 are liberal?"

Of course, every data science problem does not start with a question. It actually starts with a decision. The world confronts us. Make decisions we must. Yet, in this introductory textbook, starting with a decision to make is too hard. So, we simplify and start with a question. But we should always at least mention the sort of decision which the answer to the question might help us to make.

Note that the sophistication of these discussions increases as we go further into the book. Your discussion should be more sophisticated than that found in the previous chapter and less sophisticated than what comes later. 

Each chapter features all the same sections and sub-sections as we use below. That is, there are three sub-sections to Wisdom, five sub-sections for Justice, and so on. 

### Wisdom

Once we have our question, we can start with the Cardinal Virtues. Each section begins with a one sentence summary about the component steps of the relevant virtue. These will, obviously, be highly similar from chapter to chapter. But that is OK! We want to reinforce the steps in the path over and over again.

"Wisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of “validity,” as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population."

#### Preceptor Table

The Preceptor Table always begins with a restatement of the definition: "A Preceptor Table is smallest possible table with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, our question is easy to answer."

To create the Preceptor Table, we answer a series of questions. (Don't ask these questions rhetorically. Just describe the answer. There is also no need to number them, although you should always use this order.)

Is the question causal? We determine this by looking for words/phrases like "causal effect," "treatment effect," "cause," "influence," and so on. We look to see if the question seeks to compare two potential outcomes within the same unit, rather than the same outcome between two different units. If we see any of these clues, then the model is causal. Otherwise, it is predictive. 

What are the units? The question often makes this fairly clear, at least in terms of what each row corresponds to, whether it be individuals, classrooms or countries. But, questions often fail to make clear the total number of the rows. Our example question above does not specify the relevant population. Is it about all the people in the world? All the adults? All the adults in the United States? The purpose of this paragraph is to *refine* the question, to make it more specific. Assume that we are interested in all the adults in Chicago.

What are the outcomes? (If the model is causal, then there must have at least two potential outcomes. If you can't figure them out, then the model is probably predictive.) If the model is predictive, then there is only one outcome. This paragraph does more than just name the relevant variable. It also starts the discussion about how exactly we might measure this variable. We consider both underlying concept, "liberal," and the process by which we might operationalize the concept. Perhaps we are using a written survey with a YES/NO answer. Perhaps it is an in person interview with a 1-7 Likert scale, in which answers of 1 or 2 are coded, by us, as "liberal." The details don't matter, but we need to discuss.
 
What is the moment in time to which the question refers? Every question refers to a moment in time, even if that moment stretches a bit. The set of adults in Chicago *today* is different from the set 10 years ago, or even yesterday. Again, we need to *refine* the question. Assume that we are referring to July 1, 2012.

What are the covariates? Discussing covariates in the context of the Preceptor Table is different than discussing covariates in the context of the data. Recall that the Preceptor Table is the smallest possible table, so we don't need to include every relevant variable. *We only need to discuss variables that are necessary to answer the question.* 

What are the treatments, if any? (There are no treatments in predictive models.)



With all the above, describe the Preceptor Table.


### Justice

"Justice concerns five topics: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, unconfoundedness and the mathematical structure of the data generating mechanism (DGM)."

#### Population Table

#### Stability



#### Representativeness


Representativeness is a concern for both the data and for the Preceptor Table. If you need data for an unrepresentative subset of the population, you might be in trouble. Or, you can try to adjust your question so that it is answerable for the data you have.

#### Unconfoundedness



#### Mathematics


### Courage

"Courage centers around the creation of the data generating mechanism, i.e., our fitted model."

Use gtsummary::tbl_regression() to show a nice table of the parameter values toward the end of the Courage section.

Courage section ends with a clear statement in English, in its own paragraph, describing the model. That is, what are the two sentence which a student would say at a presentation describing the model. First sentence specifies the model, including making clear the units, outcome and key covariates. (No need to use the terms "units," "outcomes," and so on.) The second sentence tells us about one key number, along with its associated uncertainty. With predictive models, the language almost always includes "When comparing two units (whatever those units are), one with covariate (whatever it is) value X and the other with value Y, the difference in outcome is . . . " With a causal model, you are almost always interested in the average causal effect (or treatment effect), although sometimes you provide this number for a particularly interesting/important subset of the data.

### Temperance

"Temperance guides us in the use of the DGM to answer the questions wit which we began."
