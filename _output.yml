# This file contains all the important settings for creating the book.
# Think of it as its brain. By adding entries to this file, we can change
# the appearance and functions of our book. Besides entries in this file,
# bookdown also gives us the possibility to make entries in index.Rmd. 
# I am confused about what should go where. See index.Rmd file for discussion.
# Only note that entries in _output.yml
# are simply placed anywhere within the file, whereas in index.Rmd they have
# to be placed in the YAML header (that is, between the two - - - ). This file
# has been created manually, though most of the entries here are from Hadley
# Wickham's repos and https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/.

# This first-level entry specifies output options in case the book is built
# using the "bs4_book" theme. With "theme" we can individualize the theme
# more precisely, but currently only "primary" is used to specify the primary
# color of the book. A color can be specified in the form of a hex code. The
# second second-level option, repo, specifies the URL of the repo, which can
# then be called via a button in the book.

# Attempts to build either the PDF version or the epub version lead to various 
# errors. Consider revisiting this by adding something like 
#     download: ["pdf", "epub"]
# in the future.
