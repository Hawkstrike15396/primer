<!-- Two parameter chapter is missing the math. -->

<!-- Make a 15 second video, put it on YouTube. "We don't estimate parameters because we care about parameters. Parameters are imaginary! Like unicorns! [Put finger on forehead and imitate unicorn.] We estimate parameters to build Data Generating Mechanisms. And with a DGM, you can move the world!" -->

In @sec-probability, we learned how to do inference. We created a joint distribution of the models under consideration and the data which might be observed. Once we observed the data, we went from the joint distribution to the conditional distribution of possible models given the data which we did, in fact, observe. That conditional distribution, suitably normalized, was our posterior probability distribution over the space of possible models. With that distribution, we can answer any question we might (reasonably) ask.

<!-- Need a gif here. Like Hunger Games in Chapter 6. -->

*But what a pain in the ass that whole process was!* Do professionals actually go through all those steps every time they work on a data science problem? No! That would be absurd. Instead, professionals use standard tools which, in an automated fashion, take care of those steps, taking us directly from assumptions and data to the posterior:

$$\text{Prob}(\text{models} | \text{data} = \text{data we observed})$$

Even then, however, the relative likelihood of different models is not that important. Models are invisible, mental entities with no more physical presence than unicorns or leprechauns. In the world itself, we make and test predictions. *People with better models make better predictions. That is what matters.*

@sec-sampling used models with just one parameter: $\rho$, the number of red beads divided by the total number of beads in the bowl. The model in @sec-sampling was binomial, and there was only one unknown parameter, $\rho$. @sec-models did the same thing, but in the more realistic setting in a poll. In this chapter, we have two unknown parameters: the mean $\mu$ height in the US and the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the normally distributed error term.

The reason for making models is not, primarily, that making models is fun -- although it is! The reason is that the world confronts us. Make decisions we must. We must decide between options X or Y. We must choose from actions A, B and C. Confronted by a choice, we need to make a model of the world to help us choose wisely.

The real world is complex. Any substantive decision problem includes a great deal of complexity and requires even more context. We do not have the time to get into that level of detail now. So, we simplify. We are going to create a model of height for adult men. We will then use that model to answer four questions:

* What is the average height of men?

<!-- DK: Is that a good question? I guess to answer it, you would come up with a model, then fill in the Preceptor Table with 100 million rows. Take the average. Do that 1,000 times. That is your posterior. Even if that makes sense, it can't really be done. Perhaps a better question: What is the average height of 1,000 men? -->

* What is the probability that the next man we meet will be taller than 180 centimeters?

* What is the probability that, among the next 4 men we meet, the tallest is at least 10 cm taller than the shortest?

* What is our posterior probability distribution for the height of the 3rd tallest man out of the next 100 we meet?

The hope for this chapter is that, by answering these four questions, we'll gain a better and more thorough understanding of how professionals do data science.

```

Data science is ultimately a moral act, so we will use the four [Cardinal Virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues) --- Wisdom, Justice, Courage and Temperance --- to organize our approach.  

## Wisdom

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

Wisdom begins with the Preceptor Table. What data would we, ideally, require to answer our questions? We then explore the data that we actually have. We apply the concept of *validity* to ensure that the data we *want* and the data we *have* are similar enough to allow the latter to inform us about the former. If so, we describe the *population* from which both the Preceptor Table and our data are drawn.

### Preceptor Table

What rows and columns of data do you need such that, if you had them all, the calculation of the quantity of interest would be trivial? The steps we usually take to construct the Preceptor Table include:

* Is the question *causal* or *predictive*? If it is causal, then the Preceptor Table will have (at least) two potential outcome columns. If it is predictive, there will just be one outcome column. All our questions are predictive, so there is only one outcome column.

* What is the *outcome*? This is the variable which we are trying to explain/understand/predict. This is *not* the same thing as the answer to the question we have been asked. The question might, as above, be about the height of the 3rd tallest man we meet out of the next 100. But the concepts of 3rd or 100 do not appear in the Preceptor Table. Instead, height is our outcome variable. But, if we can build a model which explains/understands/predicts height, we can use that model to answer our questions.

* What are the *units*? These are the rows in the Preceptor Table. Sometimes, as here, the units will be fairly obvious: all the men in the world, one row per man. Othertimes, however, we will need to think more deeply about the units to use so that we can most easily answer our question. 

* What are the *covariates*? These are the variables, other than the outcome, about which we have information. In the case of causal models, one of the covariates is the *treatment*, the variable which we can, at least in theory, *manipulate* in order to observe the different potential outcomes. Predictive models, on the other hand, have no treatments, only covariates.

* When is the moment in *time* to which the Preceptor Table refers? This is often implicit in the question itself. One of our key roles as data scientists is to clarify the questions which we are asked. In this case, it seems clear that the questions refer to *now* but that won't always be the case.

In considering the appropriate *outcomes*, *units*, *covariates* and *time* for the Preceptor Table, we should keep in mind the data that we actually have to answer our questions. We must satisify the assumption of *validity* if we are to combine the Preceptor Table and our data into a Population Table.

If you want to know the average height of an adult in India, then the Preceptor Table would include a row for each adult in India and a column for their height. Our actual questions above imply that we want to know the average height for men, where "men" includes all males on Earth that are at least 18 years old. 

One key aspect of this Preceptor Table is whether or not we need more than one potential outcome in order to calculate our estimand. Mainly: are we are modeling (just) for prediction or are we (also) modeling for causation? Do we need a causal model, one which estimates the outcome under both treatment and control? In a causal model, the Preceptor Table would require two columns for the outcome. In this case, we are not modeling for causation; thus, we do not need two outcome columns. 

Predictive models care nothing about causation. Causal models are often also concerned with prediction, if only as a means of measuring the quality of the model. Here, we are looking at *prediction*. 

So, what does our Preceptor Table look like? Assuming we are predicting height for every adult male on planet Earth at this moment in time, we would have height data for every male at least 18 years of age. This means that we would have about 4 billion rows, one for each male, along with a column for each individual's height.

Here are some rows from our Preceptor Table: 


```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
# First, we create a tibble with the values we want for the table


tibble(ID = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "...", "Person 45,000", "Person 45,001", "..."),
       height = c("150", "172", "...", "160", "142", "...")) |>
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() |>
  cols_label(ID = md("ID"),
                height = "Height (cm)") 
```

This table would extend all the way until person 4 billion-and-something. If we had this table, all of our questions could be answered with simple math and/or simulations. No inference necessary if we have a Preceptor Table. But what does our actual data look like? 

### EDA for `nhanes`

In our quest to find suitable data, consider the `nhanes` data set from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2009 to 2011 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)
library(skimr)
glimpse(nhanes)
```

`nhanes` includes `r ncol(nhanes)` variables, including physical attributes like weight and height. Let's restrict our attention to three variables: `age`, `gender` and `height`. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
nhanes |> 
  select(age, gender, height)
```

Examine a random sample:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
nhanes |> 
  select(age, gender, height) |> 
  slice_sample(n = 5)
```

We think of both `age` and `height` as numbers. And they are numbers! But R distinguishes between "integers" and "doubles," only the second of which allow for decimal values. In the `nhanes` data, `age` is an integer and `height` is a double.


```{r}
#| code-fold: false
nhanes |> 
  select(age, gender, height) |> 
  glimpse()
```

Be on the lookout for anything suspicious. Are there any NA's in your data? What types of data are the columns, i.e. why is `age` characterized as integer instead of double? Are there more females than males? 

**You can never look at your data too closely.**

In addition to `glimpse()`, we can run `skim()`, from the **skimr** package, to calculate summary statistics. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
nhanes |> 
  select(age, gender, height) |> 
  skim()
```

Interesting! There are `r sum(is.na(nhanes$height))` missing values of height in our subset of data. Just using `glimpse()` does not show us that.  Let's filter out the NA's using `drop_na()`. This will delete the rows in which the value of any variable is missing. Because we want to examine height in men (not boys, nor females), let's limit our data to only include adult males. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
ch4 <- nhanes |> 
  filter(gender == "Male", age >= 18) |> 
  select(height) |> 
  drop_na()
```

Let's plot this data using `geom_histogram()`. 


<!-- The original version of this plot used to have a geom_density() overlay, but that stopped working for some reason. We could leave this plot as simple. After all, this is a section about EDA and we usually use simple plots on EDA. Or, we could make this plot more complex, by including a density plot. That might serve two purposes. First, we should make plots in these chapters more complex so that we have occasion to teach more plotting tricks. Second, we could use a density to teach/discuss things like 95% confidence intervals and posterior predictions. For now, I keep it simple. -->


```{r}
ch4 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
    labs(title = "Male Adult Height in the US in 2010",
         x = "Height (cm)",
         y = "Count",
         caption = "Source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey"
         ) +
    theme_classic()
```


Will the data we have --- which is only for a sample of adult American men more than a decade ago --- allow us to answer our questions, however roughly? Only if the assumption of *validity* makes sense.

### Validity

Validity involves our columns. More specifically, whether our columns mean the same thing. Does "height" in our Preceptor Table mean the same thing as "height" in NHANES? Almost certainly. Of course, we need to be careful about mistakes like measurement units, like centimeters in one and inches in the other. And there can be issues like: Are measurements taken with shoes on or shoes off? But, for the most part, the "height" variable in NHANES in 2010 is a *valid* proxy for the "height" of individuals today. We can stack the two data sets together and consider them to have come from the same population. 

Since validity holds, we can combine the Preceptor Table and our data into a Population Table.


### Population

<!-- Spend more time here? -->

One of the most important components of Wisdom is the concept of the “population.” 

The population is not the set of people for which we have data --- the participants in the CDC's Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2009 to 2011. This is the dataset. Nor is it the set of all the individuals about whom we would like to have data. Those are the rows in the Preceptor Table. The population is the larger — potentially much larger — set of individuals which include both the data we *have* and the data we *want*. Generally, **the population will be much larger than either the data we have or the data we want.** In fact, there is almost always a time dimension to consider. We generally want to make inferences about right now or about the future. By definition, the data we have is always from the past.

In this case, we want to estimate average height for males *today*, not for people in 2009 -- 2011. We also want to estimate height for males outside the United States, a group that is excluded from our dataset. Is it reasonable to generate conclusions for the world from this group? Maybe? We have limited data to work with and we have to determine how far we are willing to generalize to other groups.

It is a judgment call, a matter of Wisdom, as to whether or not we may assume that the data we have and the data we want to have (i.e., the Preceptor Table) are drawn from the same population.

In the social sciences, *there is never a perfect relationship between the data you have and the question you are trying to answer.* Data for American males in the past is not the same thing as data for American males today. Nor is it the same as the data for men in France or Mexico. Yet, this data is relevant. Right? It is certainly better than nothing. 

*Using not-perfect data is generally better than using no data at all.*

Is not-perfect data *always* better? No! If your problem is estimating the median height of 5th grade girls in Tokyo, we doubt that our data is at all relevant. Wisdom recognizes the danger of using non-relevant data to build a model and then mistakenly using that model in a way which will only make the situation worse. If the data won't help, don't use the data, don't build a model. Better to just use your common sense and experience. Or find better data.


## Justice

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

Having looked at our data and decided that it is "close enough" to our questions that creating a model will help us come up with better answers, we move on to Justice. 

Justice emphasizes a few key concepts:

* The *Population Table*, a structure which includes a row for every unit in the population. We generally break the rows in the Population Table into three categories: the data for units we want to have (the Preceptor Table), the data for units which we actually have (our actual data), and the data for units we do not care about (the rest of the population, not included in the data or the Preceptor Table).

* *Stability* means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn. 

* *Representativeness*, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case. 

* *Unconfoundedness* means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates. This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We write that a model is “confounded” if this is not true. The easiest way to ensure unconfoundedness is to randonly assign treatment.

* The mathematical structure of the *Data Generating Mechanism*. Models require math, so we need to create a mathematical formula which connects our outcome to our covariates.

### The Population Table

The Population Table shows rows from three sources: the **Preceptor Table**, the **actual data**, and the **population** (outside of the data).

Our **Preceptor Table** rows contain the information that we would *want* to know in order to answer our questions. These rows contain entries for our covariates (sex and year) but they do not contain any outcome results (height). We are trying to answer questions about the male population in 2024, so our sex entries for these rows will read "Male" and our year entries of these rows will read "2024". 

Our **actual data** rows contain the information that we *do* know. These rows contain entries for both our covariates *and* the outcomes. In this case, the actual data comes from a study conducted on males in 2009-2011, so our sex entries for these rows will read "Male" and our year entries of these rows will either read "2009", "2010", or "2011".

Our **other** rows contain no data. These are subjects which fall under our desired population, but for which we have no data. As such, all outcomes and covariates are missing. (A subtle point is that, even for other data, we "know" the ID and the Year for each subject. Of course, we don't *really* know these things, but, conceptually, we are defining the meaning of those rows on the basis of those variables.)

<!-- GP: I changed everything but the explanation for the **population** rows. I am confused; shouldn't the population rows still contain "Male" in the sex column? Because this entire chapter, we've exclusively been discussing the male population, so at least that much should be known, no? -->

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(source = c("Preceptor Table", "Preceptor Table", "...",
                  "Actual Data", "Actual Data", "Actual Data", "...", 
                  "Other", "Other", "Other"),
       gender = c("Male", "Male", "...",
                  "Male", "Male", "Male", "...",
                  "?", "?", "?"),
       year = c("2024", "2024", "...",
                "2009", "2011", "2010", "...",
                "?", "?", "?"),
       height = c("?", "?", "...",
                 "180", "160", "168", "...",
                 "?", "?", "?")) |>
  
  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty
  
  gt() |>
  cols_label(source = md("Source"),
             gender = md("Sex"),
             year = md("Year"),
             height = md("Height")) |>
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = c(source))) |>
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle", size = "large"), 
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = c(source))) |>
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything()) |>
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = c(source)) |>
  fmt_markdown(columns = everything())  
```

### Representativeness

*Representativeness involves the rows of the Population Table.* More specifically, are the rows that we *do* have data for representative of the rows for which we *do not* have data? Ideally, the data we have is a random, unbiased selection from our population, and so the answer to our question is yes.



For our `nhanes` data, is this the case? It is time to investigate.

According to the CDC, individuals are invited to participate in NHANES based on a randomized process. First, the United States is divided into a number of geographical groups (to ensure counties from all areas). From each of these groups, counties are randomly selected to participate. After a county has been randomly selected, members of the households in that county are notified of the upcoming survey, and must volunteer their time to participate. 
It is clear that this process goes through several layers of randomization (promising!). That being said, many counties are excluded by the end of the process. It is also possible for certain groups or communities to be less representative of the greater population, though we cannot know that for certain. 

There is also the fact that participation is voluntary. Perhaps certain individuals (immobile, elderly, anxious) are less likely to participate. Perhaps individuals that are hospitalized do not get the opportunity to participate. This impacts our data! 

 
<!-- DK: Insert conclusion for this section. -->

## Courage

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```

In data science, *we deal with words, math, and code, but the most important of these is code.* We need Courage to create the model, to take the leap of faith that we can make our ideas real. 

Justice gave us the Population Table. Courage selects the data generating mechanism. We first specify the mathematical formula which connects the outcome variable we are interested in with the other data that we have. We explore different models. We need to decide which variables to include and to estimate the values of unknown parameters. We check our models for consistency with the data we have. We avoid hypothesis tests. We select one model.

We use a simple linear model:

$$ y_i =  \mu + \epsilon_i $$

with $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. $y_i$ is the height of male $i$. $\mu$ is the average height of all males in the population. $\epsilon_i$ is the "error term," the difference between the height of male $i$ and the average height of all males.

$\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. The mean being 0 relates to our concept of **accuracy**; we are assuming that our data is representative enough to be accurate, and so we can expect our average error to be 0. The standard deviation, on the other hand, relates to our concept of **precision**; the smaller $\sigma$ is, the more precise our data is, and the larger $\sigma$ is, the less precise our data is. 

This is the simplest model we can construct. Note: 

* The model has two unknown parameters: $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Before we can do anything else we need to estimate the values of these parameters. Can we ever know their exact value? No! Perfection lies only in God's own R code. But, by using a Bayesian approach similar to what we used in Chapters @sec-probability and @sec-models, we will be able to create a *posterior probability distribution* for each parameter.

<!-- Add Dr. Box quote. All models are wrong, some are useful. And a photo. -->

* The model is wrong, as are all models. 

* The parameter we most care about is $\mu$. That is the parameter with a substantively meaningful interpretation. Not only is the meaning of $\sigma$ difficult to describe, we also don't particular care about its value. Parameters like $\sigma$ in this context are *nuisance* or *auxiliary* parameters. We still estimate their posterior distributions, but we don't really care what those posteriors look like.

* $\mu$ is not the average height of the men in the sample. We can calculate that directly. It is `r mean(ch4$height)`. No estimation required! Instead, $\mu$ is the average height of men in the *population*. Recall from the discussions in @sec-models that the population is the universe of people/units/whatever about which we seek to draw conclusions. On some level, this seems simple. On a deeper level, it is very subtle. For example, if we are walking around Copenhagen, then the population we really care about, in order to answer our three questions, is the set of adult men which we might meet today. This is not the same as the population of adult men in the US in 2010. But is it close enough? Is it better than nothing? We want to assume that both men from `nhanes` (the data we have) and men we meet in Copenhagen today (the data we want to have) are drawn from the same *population*. Each case is a different and the details matter.

* $\sigma$ is an estimate for the standard deviation of the errors,  i.e., variability in height after accounting for the mean.

#### Models

Let's estimate a simple version of the model. First, we need to load the **brms** and **tidybayes** packages.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| message: false
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
```

Because we are estimating a linear model, we begin with:


```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| message: false

fit_1 <- brm(formula = height ~ 1,
             data = ch4,
             family = gaussian())
```

Note:

* There is a direct connection between the mathematical form of the model created under Justice and the code we use to fit the model under Courage. `height ~ 1` is the code equivalent of $y_i =  \mu$. 

* Setting `family = gaussian()` implies that $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, just as we assumed. That is not a coincidence! If $\epsilon_i$ had a different distribution, we would need to use a different statistical family. 

* There are several ways to examine the fitted model. The simplest is to print it. Recall that just typing `x` at the prompt is the same as writing `print(x)`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
fit_1
```






Running `tidy()` on the fitted model object provides more detail.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
tidy(fit_obj)
```





We see the output for the two parameters of the model: "(Intercept)" and "sigma". This can be confusing! Recall that the thing we care most about is $\mu$, the average height in the population. If we had the Preceptor Table --- with a row for every adult male in the population we care about and no missing data --- $\mu$ would be trivial to calculate, and with no uncertainty. But only we know that we named that parameter $\mu$. All that R sees is the `1` in the formula. In most fields of statistics, this constant term is called the "intercept." So, now we have three things --- $\mu$ (from the math), `1` (from the code), and "(Intercept)" (from the output) --- all of which refer to the exact same concept. This will not be the last time that terminology will be confusing.

At this point, `stan_glm()` --- or rather the `print()` method for objects created with `stan_glm()` --- has a problem. We have full posteriors for both $\mu$ and $\sigma$. But this is a simple printed summary. We can't show the entire distribution. So, what are the best few numbers to provide? There is no right answer to this question! Here, the choice is to provide the "Median" of the posterior and the "MAD_SD". 

* Anytime you have a distribution, whether posterior probability or otherwise, the most important single number associated with it is some measure of its *location*. Where is the data? The two most common choices for this measure are the mean and median. We use the median here because posterior distributions can often be quite skewed, making the mean a less stable measure.

* The second most important number for summarizing a distribution concerns its *spread*. How far is the data spread around its center? The most common measure used for this is the standard deviation. MAD SD, the scaled median absolute deviation, is another. If the variable has a normal distribution, then the standard deviation and the MAD SD will be very similar. But the MAD SD is much more robust to outliers, which is why it is used here. (Note that MAD SD is the same measure as what we have referred to as *mad* up till now. The measure is calculated with the `mad()` command in R. Terminology is confusing, as usual.)


We can also change the number of digits shown:

```{r}
print(fit_obj, detail = FALSE, digits = 1)
```

<!-- DK: Are we sure that coef() and sigma() give us the median values? Please investigate. -->

Now that we understand the meaning of Median and MAD_SD in the above display, we can interpret the actual numbers. The median of the intercept, `r round(coef(fit_obj), 1)`, is the median of our posterior distribution for $\mu$, the average height of all men in the population. The median of sigma, `r round(sigma(fit_obj), 1)`, is the median of our posterior distribution for the true $\sigma$, which can be roughly understood as the variability in the height of men, once we account for our estimate of $\mu$.


```{r}
#| echo: false
## DK: Seems like there ought to be a better way of doing this. Aren't there
## ways for pulling at the median and mad_sd directly, rather than calculating
## them ourselves? Please investigate.

median_fit <- fit_obj |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  pull(`(Intercept)`) |> 
  median()

mad_sd <- fit_obj |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  pull(`(Intercept)`) |> 
  mad()
```


The MAD SD for each parameter is a measure of the variability of our posterior distributions for that parameter. How spread out are they? Speaking roughly, 95% of the mass of a posterior probability distribution is located within +/- 2 MAD SDs from the median. For example, we would be about 95% confident that the true value of $\mu$ is somewhere between `r round(median_fit - 2 * mad_sd, 1)` and `r round(median_fit + 2 * mad_sd, 1)`. 

<!-- *Pictures speak where math mumbles.* -->

<!-- DK: Add tbl_regression from gtsummary -->

<!-- Add posterior predictive checks using, perhaps, https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/pp_check.stanreg.html -->


<!-- ### Testing -->


<!-- Discuss testing for the first time. Give simple example of how people test. Explain how people test. Null hypothesis, is that the average height of men is 173 cm.

We have a model. What can we do with it? Let's answer the four questions with which we started.

### Question 1

* What is the average height of men?

If we had the Preceptor Table, one with a row for every man alive, and with their actual height, we could calculate this number easily. Just take the average of those 3 billion or so rows! Alas, in our actual Preceptor Table, the vast majority of heights are missing. Question marks make simple algebra impossible. So, as with any unknown number, we need to estimate a posterior probability distribution. Objects created by `stan_glm()` make this easy to do.

```{r}
newobs <- tibble(.rows = 1)

pe <- posterior_epred(object = fit_obj,
                      newdata = newobs) |> 
        as_tibble()

pe
```

We will use `posterior_epred()` many times. The two key arguments are `object`, the fitted model object returned by `stan_glm()`, and `newdata`, which is the tibble which contains the covariate values associated with the unit (or units) for which we want to make a forecast. (In this case, `newdata` can be any tibble because an intercept-only model does not make use of covariates. We don't really need a variable named `constant`, but including it does no harm.) The `epred` in `posterior_epred()` stands for **e**xpected **pred**iction. In other words, if we pick a random adult male what do we "expect" his height to be. We also call this the *expected value*.

<!-- DK: Tell the story about "mathematical hope." Maybe give more details on what the tibble is doing. Once new version comes out, replace with tibble(.rows = 1). -->

We use `as_tibble()` to convert the matrix which is returned by `posterior_epred()`. We have a tibble with 1 column and 4,000 rows. The column, unhelpfully named `1`, is 4,000 draws from the posterior probability distribution for the expected height of a random male. Recall from earlier chapters how a posterior probability distribution and the draws from a posterior probability distribution are, more or less, the same thing. Or, rather, a posterior probability distribution, its ownself, is hard to work with. Draws from that distribution, on the other hand, are easy to manipulate. We use draws to answer our questions. 

Converting these 4,000 draws into a posterior probability distribution is straightforward.

```{r}
pe |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior for Average Adult Male Height",
         subtitle = "Note that the plot is very similar to the one created with the parameters",
         x = expression(mu),
         y = "Probability",
         caption = "Data source: NHANES") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

<!-- DK: Remove mu above. -->

The rest of the *Primer* will be filled with graphics like this one. You will make dozens of them yourself. The fundamental structure for doing algebra is the real number. The fundamental structure for data science is the posterior probability distribution. You need to be able to create and interpret them.


### Question 2

* What is the probability that the next adult male we meet will be taller than 180 centimeters?

There are two fundamentally different kinds of unknowns which we care about: *expected values* (as in the previous question) and *predicted values*. With the former, we are not interested in any specific individual. The individual value is irrelevant. With predicted values, we care, not about the average, but about this specific person. With the former, we use `posterior_epred()`. With the latter, the relevant function is `posterior_predict()`. Both functions return draws from a posterior probability distribution, but the unknown number which underlies the posterior is very different.

Recall the mathematics:


$$ y_i =  \mu + \epsilon_i $$

With expected values or averages, we can ignore the $\epsilon_i$ term in this formula. The expected value of $\epsilon_i$ is zero since, by assumption, $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. However, we can't ignore $\epsilon_i$ when predicting the height for a single individual.

```{r}
newobs <- tibble(.rows = 1)

pp <- posterior_predict(object = fit_obj,
                        newdata = newobs) |> 
        as_tibble()

pp
```


As before, it is straightforward to turn draws from the posterior probability distribution into a graphic:

```{r}
pp |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior for Height of Random Male",
         subtitle = "Uncertainty for a single individual is much greater than for the expected value",
         x = expression(mu),
         y = "Probability",
         caption = "Data source: NHANES") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

Note:

* The posterior for an individual is much wider than the posterior for the expected value.  

* Eyeballing, seems like there is a 1 out of 3 chance that the next man we meet, or any randomly chosen man, is taller than 180 cm.

* We can calculate the exact probability by manipulating the tibble of draws directly.

```{r}
sum(pp$`1` > 180)/length(pp$`1`)
```

If 30% or so of the draws from the posterior probability distribution are greater than 180 cm, then there is about a 30% chance that the next individual will be taller than 180 cm.

Again, the key conceptual difficulty is the population. The problem we actually have involves walking around London, or wherever, today. The data we have involve America in 2010. Those are not the same things! But they are not totally different. Knowing whether the data we have is "close enough" to the problem we want to solve is at the heart of Wisdom. Yet that was the decision we made at the start of the process, the decision to create a model in the first place. Now that we have created a model, we look to the virtue of Temperance for guidance in using that model. The data we have is never a perfect match for the world we face. We need to temper our confidence and act with humility. Our forecasts will never be as good as a naive use of the model might suggest. Reality will surprise us. We need to take the model's claims with a family-sized portion of salt.

<!-- DK: More on temperance and the many ways that we should be less confident. Move material from Chapters 3 and 5 here? -->

### Question 3

<!-- DK: Discuss how each row of pp is like a random draw from the scenario of 4 new men. So, we can look at each row without considering any other row. Makes simulation studies much easier. -->

* What is the probability that, among the next 4 men we meet, the tallest is at least 10 cm taller than the shortest?

Bayesian models are beautiful because, via the magic of simulation, we can answer (almost!) any question. Because the question is about four random individuals, we need `posterior_predict()` to give us four sets of draws from four identical posterior probability distributions. Start with a new `newobs`:

```{r}
newobs <- tibble(.rows = 4)

newobs
```

If you need to predict X individuals, then you need a tibble with X rows, regardless of whether or not those rows are otherwise identical.

```{r}
pp <- posterior_predict(object = fit_obj,
                        newdata = newobs) |> 
        as_tibble() 

pp
```

The next step is to calculate the number of interest. We can not, directly, draw the height of the tallest or shortest out of 4 random men. However, having drawn 4 random men, we can calculate those numbers, and the difference between them.

```{r}
# First part of the code is the same as we did above.

pp <- posterior_predict(object = fit_obj,
                        newdata = newobs) |> 
        as_tibble() |> 
  
        # Second part of the code requires some trickery.
  
        rowwise() |> 
        mutate(tallest = max(c_across())) |> 
        mutate(shortest = min(c_across())) |> 
        mutate(diff = tallest - shortest) 
        
pp        
```

These steps serve as a template for much of the analysis we do later. It is often very hard to create a model *directly* of the thing we want to know. There is no *easy* way to create a model which estimates this height difference *directly*. It is easy, however, to create a model which allows for random draws. 

*Give us enough random draws, and a tibble in which to store them, and we can estimate the world.*

Once we have random draws from the posterior distribution we care about, graphing the posterior probability distribution is the same-old, same-old.


```{r}
pp |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = diff)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior for Max Height Difference Among Four Men",
         subtitle = "The expected value for this difference would be much more narrow",
         x = "Height Difference in Centimeters",
         y = "Probability",
         caption = "Data source: NHANES") + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, 10),
                       labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) 
```

There is about an `r round(100 * sum(pp$diff > 10) / length(pp$diff))`% chance that, when meeting 4 random men, the tallest will be at least 10 cm taller than the shortest. Exact calculation:

```{r}
sum(pp$diff > 10) / length(pp$diff)
```


<!-- DK: Discuss all the reasons why this might not be true. Show how to give the exact answer. -->

### Question 4

* What is our posterior probability distribution of the height of the 3rd tallest man out of the next 100 we meet?

The same approach will work for almost any question.

```{r}
newobs <- tibble(.rows =  100)

pp <- posterior_predict(object = fit_obj,
                        newdata = newobs) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(third_tallest = sort(c_across(), 
                              decreasing = TRUE)[3])
```

Explore the `pp` object. It has `r ncol(pp)` columns: one hundred for the 100 individual heights and one column for the 3rd tallest among them. Having done the hard work, plotting is easy:

```{r}
pp |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = third_tallest, y = after_stat(count / sum(count)))) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior for Height of 3rd Tallest Man from Next 100",
         subtitle = "Should we have more or less certainty about behavior in the tails?",
         x = expression(mu),
         y = "Probability",
         caption = "Data source: NHANES") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) 
    
```

### Three Levels of Knowledge

When answering questions as we have been, it can be easy to falsely believe that we are delivering *the truth*. This is not the case. In fact, there are three primary levels of knowledge which we need to understand in order to account for our uncertainty. 

The three primary levels of knowledge possible knowledge in our scenario include: the Truth (the Preceptor Table), the DGM Posterior, and Our Posterior.

#### The Truth

If we know the Truth (with a capital “T”), then we know the Preceptor Table. With that knowledge, we can directly answer our question precisely. We can calculate each individual’s height, and any summary measure we might be interested in, like the average height for different ages or countries. 

This level of knowledge is possible only under an omniscient power, one who can see every outcome in every individual under every treatment. The Truth would show, for any given individual, their actions under control, their actions under treatment, and each little factor that impacted those decisions.

The Truth represents the highest level of knowledge one can have — with it, our questions merely require algebra. There is no need to estimate a treatment effect, or the different treatment effects for different groups of people. We would not need to predict at all — we would know.

#### DGM posterior

The DGM posterior is the next level of knowledge, which lacks the omniscient quality of The Truth. This posterior is the posterior we would calculate if we had perfect knowledge of the data generating mechanism, meaning we have the correct model structure and exact parameter values. This is often falsely conflated with “our posterior,” which is subject to error in model structure and parameter value estimations.

What we do with the DGM posterior is the same as our posterior — we estimate parameters based on data and predict the future with the latest and most relevant information possible. The difference is that, when we calculate posteriors for an unknown value in the DGM posterior, we expect those posteriors to be perfect.

#### Our posterior

Unfortunately, our posterior possesses even less certainty! In the real world, we don’t have perfect knowledge of the DGM: the model structure and the exact parameter values. What does this mean?

When we go to our boss, we tell them that this is our best guess. It is an informed estimate based on the most relevant data possible. From that data, we have created a posterior for the average height of males. 

Does this mean we are certain that the average height lies is the most probable outcome in our posterior? Of course not! As we would tell our boss, it would not be shocking to find out that the actual average height was less or more than our estimate.

This is because a lot of the assumptions we make during the process of building a model, the processes in Wisdom, are subject to error. Perhaps our data did not match the future as well as we had hoped. Ultimately, we try to account for our uncertainty in our estimates. Even with this safeguard, we aren’t surprised if we are a bit off.

<!-- DK: Need more text. Explain all the things that could be wrong with the model. Explain what is going on in different columns. Explain all the cool R code tricks. Discuss difference between predict and epred.  -->





## Summary

<!-- DK: Discuss meaning of "Posterior" in all plot titles. Show the key code examples. -->

The next five chapters will follow the same process we have just completed here. We start with a decision we have to make. With luck, we will have some data to guide us. (Without data, even the best data scientist will struggle to make progress.) *Wisdom* asks us: "Is the data we have close enough to the decision we face to make using that data helpful?" Often times, the answer is "No." 

Once we start to build the model, *Justice* will guide us. Is the model descriptive or causal? What is the mathematical relationship between the dependent variable we are trying to explain and the independent variables we can use to explain it? What assumptions are we making about distribution of the error term?

Having set up the model framework, we need *Courage* to implement the model in code. Without code, all the math in the world is useless. Once we have created the model, we need to understand it. What are the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters? Do they seem sensible? How should we interpret them?

*Temperance* guides the final step. With a model, we can finally get back to the decision which motivated the exercise in the first place. We can use the model to make statements about the world, both to confirm that the model is consistent with the world and to use the model to make predictions about numbers which we do not know. 

Let's practice this process another dozen or so times.
