*Data science is data cleaning.*

## Overview

Cleaning and wrangling data is a major part of any real world data science project. Chapters 13 through 20 of [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund provide a good overview of these issues. Read those chapters and complete the associated tutorials from the [**r4ds.tutorials**]() package.

However, those chapters do not cover some useful statistical functions, so we introduce them below.

The only package we need in this chapter is **tidyverse**.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Comics


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png")
```



## Summary

*Data science is data cleaning.*

*Real data is nasty.*
